Users can select the operands and operators with click events,
and The desired ouput will be the result of the operation displayed on the screen

## PSEUDOCODE

The algorithm in Pseudocode for this problem includes:
when a user clicks a operator and operand, it is stored. however, the equals button signals for the operation to be done, and its result is displayed to the screen when a user clicks the clear button, varibles containing all initial values are clear to re-begin
